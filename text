Next Steps & Suggestions
Guest Management:

You might want to implement the GuestPage similarly to EventPage, where you can create, list, and manage guests for an event.
Budget & Expense Tracking:

Develop the budget and expense tracking features. You can create a BudgetPage and ExpensePage to manage these aspects of the events.
Profile Page - Finalization:

Complete the handleChange function and ensure that the profile page works as expected with the ability to edit user details.
Event Editing & Deletion:

Implement the handleEdit and handleDelete functions within the EventPage to enable users to modify or remove events.

Invitation to Guest:
Create a new component and actions for managing invitations. The basic idea is to have a form where the user can select an event, enter guest details, and send an invitation.

RSVP Tracking:
Create another component for tracking RSVPs. This component will allow guests to respond to invitations and will update the RSVP status in the database.
